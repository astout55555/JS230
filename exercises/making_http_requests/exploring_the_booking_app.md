3

5. Do all staff have schedules?

No, staff with IDs 4 and 5 do not. However, no 1 route will provide the answer, since I must compare the schedules with the IDs of the staff and see if any are missing, using 2 routes.

6. Did all students book a schedule?

No, students with IDs 1 and 5 did not. However, no 1 route will provide the answer, since I must compare schedules with the emails of the students, using 2 routes.
